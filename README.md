Singers Nights will be in the bar although if numbers dictate we are able to use the auditorium although please be advised that this is not as warm and cosy as the bar area

Songwriter Tom Bliss is stepping back on stage after many years in retirement to raise money for multiple sclerosis research as his daughter Ella has sadly developed this dreadful disease.<br>
These gigs started in 2017 and have so far raised over £8,000 and we are delighted that we have persuade him to come to Springthorpe Live.  <br>
Tom and Den are both multi-instrumentalists, so expect guitar, mandola, bass, whistle, keyboards, autoharp, harmonica (and a few other surprises!) as well as tight vocal harmonies<br>
